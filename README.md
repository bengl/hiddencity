Games are going to be in the browser. 

Blah blah blah

I recommend you grab an [XBOX 360 controller for the PC with the wireless adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Windows/dp/B004QRKWKQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1361080852&sr=8-6&keywords=xbox+360+pc+wireless+gaming+receiver&tag=deanp-20). This will work with other wireless controllers using the same receiver. You can also buy [the receiver separately](http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows/dp/B000HZFCT2/ref=pd_sim_vg_1?tag=deanp-20).
